*Scripts*
- `parse_games_to_teams.py`
- `parse_player_num_to_name.py`

These scripts were run on the first four matchdays of the 2015-16 Champions
League season in order to grab the teams and players who played in the 2015-16
season. 

All teams can be found in `all_teams_in_games.txt` and all players who played in
the first four matchdays can be found in the directory `all_players_in_games`,
where each txt file is delineated by team.
